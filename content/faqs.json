    "question": "How long does shipping take?",
    "answer": "UK delivery typically takes 3-5 working days. International shipping is available and usually takes 7-14 working days depending on the destination. All prints are carefully packaged in rigid tubes or flat packs to prevent damage in transit."

  {
    "question": "Can I license an image for commercial use?",
    "answer": "Yes — I offer licensing for editorial, commercial, and personal projects. Please get in touch via the contact page with details of how you'd like to use the image, and I'll provide a quote. Licensing terms and pricing vary depending on usage, duration, and territory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you take on commissions?",
    "answer": "Absolutely — I'm open to just about anything. Whether it's something you already have in mind or just the seed of an idea, I'd love to hear about it. Drop me a message through the contact page and let's see what we can create together."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the turnaround time for commissions?",
    "answer": "This depends on the scope of the project. For a straightforward shoot, you can typically expect edited images within 2-3 weeks. For larger projects, I'll provide a timeline during the briefing stage. Weather-dependent landscape work sometimes requires flexibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your returns policy?",
    "answer": "If your print arrives damaged, please contact me within 7 days with a photo of the damage and I'll arrange a replacement through Picfair. As prints are produced to order, I'm unable to accept returns for change of mind — but I'm always happy to help you choose the right size and finish before you order."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are digital downloads available?",
    "answer": "Yes, high-resolution digital downloads are available for most images through Picfair. These are suitable for personal use such as wallpapers and screensavers. For commercial digital use, please enquire about licensing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What camera gear do you use?",
    "answer": "My main camera is a Fujifilm X-T30. I love both film and digital — for film I shoot with an Olympus OM-1 and have a few other film cameras I rotate through, including a Nikon FM2 which is one of my all-time favourites. My Sony A5000 comes out when conditions get rough, since I don't mind if it takes a beating."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use your photos on social media?",
    "answer": "If you've purchased a print or digital download, you're welcome to share a photo of it on social media with credit. However, the digital files themselves are not licensed for redistribution on social media without a separate licence. If you'd like to share or repost one of my images, please get in touch first."
