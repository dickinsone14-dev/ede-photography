    "question": "Can I license an image for commercial use?",

    "question": "Do you take on commissions?",
    "answer": "I'm available for photography commissions across the UK. This could include property photography, tourism campaigns, magazine features, or bespoke prints. Reach out via the contact form with your brief and I'll be happy to discuss."

  {
    "question": "What's the turnaround time for commissions?",
    "answer": "This depends on the scope of the project. For a straightforward shoot, you can typically expect edited images within 2-3 weeks. For larger projects, I'll provide a timeline during the briefing stage. Weather-dependent landscape work sometimes requires flexibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your returns policy?",
    "answer": "If your print arrives damaged, please contact me within 7 days with a photo of the damage and I'll arrange a replacement through Picfair. As prints are produced to order, I'm unable to accept returns for change of mind — but I'm always happy to help you choose the right size and finish before you order."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are digital downloads available?",
    "answer": "Yes, high-resolution digital downloads are available for most images through Picfair. These are suitable for personal use such as wallpapers and screensavers. For commercial digital use, please enquire about licensing."

  {
    "question": "What camera gear do you use?",
    "answer": "I primarily shoot with a Sony Alpha series mirrorless camera. You can see my full gear list on the About page. That said, the best camera is the one you have with you — some of my favourite shots have been taken on a phone during an unplanned moment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use your photos on social media?",
    "answer": "If you've purchased a print or digital download, you're welcome to share a photo of it on social media with credit. However, the digital files themselves are not licensed for redistribution on social media without a separate licence. If you'd like to share or repost one of my images, please get in touch first."
